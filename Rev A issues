- swapped RX1 and TX1, swap IC1 pins 53 and 54
- C28, C29, C54 and C55 need more reasonalbe footprints
- I/O decoder address (U8) inputs should be other way around,
  swap pin 1 with 3
- ROM disable circuit can be simplified, U27A can be removed
  and ROM disable signal can be routed to U20 pin 3 instead
- Wierd kicad schematic glitch - A0 to the sound subsystem is
  actually connected to D0 instead. Isolate U11 pin 6 and route
  A0 signal from the CPU instead to fix the issue.
